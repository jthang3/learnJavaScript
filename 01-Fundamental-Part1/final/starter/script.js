//datatype

//primitive data type

/*
number
string
boolean
undefined -> variables not yet defined.
null - also mean empty value
Symbol (ES2015) - Value that is unique and cannot be changed - const name = "John"
BigInt (ES2020) - larger integers than the Number type can hold.

JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of 
the value stored in a variable. Data types are determined automatically. */
